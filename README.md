# Two-way-communication-app-with-ASL-sign-language

Sign language is one of the oldest and most natural form of language for communication, hence we have come up with a real time method using neural networks for finger spelling based American sign language. Automatic human gesture recognition from camera images is an interesting topic for developing vision. We propose a convolution neural network (CNN) method to recognize hand gestures of human actions from an image captured by camera. The purpose is to recognize hand gestures of human task activities from a camera image. The position of hand and orientation are applied to obtain the training and testing data for the CNN. The hand is first passed through a filter and after the filter is applied where the hand is passed through a classifier which predicts the class of the hand gestures. Then the calibrated images are used to train CNN. 
 
 **Objective:**
To create a computer software and train a model using CNN which takes an image of hand gesture of American Sign Language and shows the output of the particular sign language in text format converts it into audio format. And audio format to ASL sign language as the output.
